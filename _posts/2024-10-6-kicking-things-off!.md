Hey! I'm Ali, and if you're reading this, you're either here by accident (oops!) or you're curious about what I do. Either way, welcome to my little corner of the web!

I'm a techie with a focus on servers and networking, but I also dive into all kinds of other stuff. Whether it's **self-hosting**, **automation**, or **microcontrollers**, I love exploring and learning as I go.

This blog is going to be my way of documenting what Iâ€™m working on, what Iâ€™m learning, and maybe a few random tech rants along the way.

## What to Expect

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll probably see around here:

- **Servers & Networking:** Iâ€™m all about building, maintaining, and tinkering with servers and network setups.
- **Self-hosting Projects:** I like keeping things under my control, and self-hosting is a huge part of that.
- **Random Tech Stuff:** From trying out new tools to solving weird tech problems, Iâ€™m always experimenting.

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This

I like sharing what I learn, and honestly, documenting things helps me keep track of it all. Plus, if it helps someone else along the way, even better!

So, stick around if you're into tech, learning, and the occasional deep dive into the stuff Iâ€™m working on. And if youâ€™ve got any cool tips or suggestions, hit me up!

Till next time ðŸ‘‹
